    <p>I am Oscar and style has never been my area of expertise. I am Oscar and I recently dropped out of an MA program in English Composition becuase I found a new love with programming. I am about half-way through my webdev A.S and can't wait to start the new Data Science Program.</p>
    <p>I love teaching the students, but I enjoy programming more. Thanks for teaching me CSS and HTML so that I can make my webpages not look like they did in the 2000s.</p>
